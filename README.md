# Cofund Challenge

Hey there! Welcome to the COYO frontend challenge. Don't be afraid, the main focus is not about failing or succeeding in the given tasks, but to have a chat about the code, style and architectural things of the project. So let's go.

## The project

This project was born for the Covid-19 Hackathon https://wirvsvirus.org/ back in March 2020. The source code here reflects an early state, fastly boostrapped on a friday evening. You will probably find a number of 'dodgy' things ;)

### Business case

The idea behind the project is to help small local shops or restaurant through the pandemic situation by donations.

This is the admin control panel. We can see all the companies that received donations and the specific transactions and payouts.

To login, you can enter anything (as token).

## Requirements

- Your IDE of preference

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## How to start

- On the first start run `npm install`, on consecutive runs you can ignore this step. 
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
- The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Remember you can input any token to login into the app.

## Tasks

- Have a look through the code.
